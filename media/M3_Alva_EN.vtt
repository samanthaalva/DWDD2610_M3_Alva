Hello, my name is Samantha Alva

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.400
and I'm currently coding a website

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.240
for my Web Design and Development 2610 class

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.840
And uh, yeah, it's in Module 3

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.800
and I'm calling my website "Urban Design"

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.280
To emulate this ✨feeling✨ I 
want for a construction website

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm starting my process in Figma

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.400
I'm looking at color schemes, I'm mocking up ideas

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.520
And I landed on an orange, 
green and blue color scheme

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.400
Where I want the blue to compliment the orange, 
and I want the green to act as a tertiary color

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.080
On top of that, I'm also using a blocky font

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.240
To kind of emulate the look 
and feel of blocky buildings

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.200
*Rambling about blocks continues*

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.120
But yeah, other than that, we are good to go

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.600
and we'll see how it turns out in the end

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.031
Thank you *THUD*
